Read-only Teams readiness and cross-tenant checklist.

- Search for Teams manifest and packaging artefacts under /data/order-processing (or subdirs):
  - manifest.json, appPackage/, teamsapp.yml, Teams Toolkit files, bot registration notes
- If present, summarise:
  - bot id / endpoints placeholders
  - personal tab configuration
- Cross-tenant:
  - extract and summarise steps required in Tenant A vs Tenant B from CROSS_TENANT_TEAMS_DEPLOYMENT.md
  - list what is still unknown (permissions, consent, app catalogue path)

Output: is the Teams app package ready? if not, what needs building.
