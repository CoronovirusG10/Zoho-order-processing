# Sub-agent: Teams Personal Tab UI

## Deliverables
- React tab that shows:
  - My Cases list (default)
  - Case detail view (artefacts, status, issues, approvals)
  - Manager view (All Cases) when role present
- Integrate Teams SSO and call backend API with token.

## Constraints
- No deployment; local dev instructions only.
- UI should be minimal but functional.
