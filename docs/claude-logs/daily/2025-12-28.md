## Session 10: Zoho Sandbox Data Population (Completion)

### Objective
Complete Zoho Books sandbox population - finish remaining sales orders and invoices.

### Context
Continued from Session 9 (Dec 27) which hit rate limit at 132/313 sales orders.

### Work Completed

| Time | Task | Outcome |
|------|------|---------|
| Start | Tested API - rate limit reset confirmed | ✅ Working |
| +5m | Imported remaining sales orders | 313 total: 296 created, 17 failed |
| +10m | Imported all invoices | 251 total: 234 created, 17 failed |
| +12m | Updated all logs | Complete |

### Final Import Results

| Entity | Total | Created | Skipped | Failed | Status |
|--------|-------|---------|---------|--------|--------|
| Customers | 524 | 240 | 284 | 0 | ✅ Complete |
| Products | 477 | 477 | 0 | 0 | ✅ Complete |
| Sales Orders | 313 | 296 | 0 | 17 | ✅ Complete |
| Invoices | 251 | 234 | 0 | 17 | ✅ Complete |

**Total records imported:** 1,247 / 1,565 (79.6%)

### Failures Explained

The 34 failures (17 sales orders + 17 invoices) are all the same issue:
- **Error**: "Make sure that you have selected a contact of the correct contact type (customer/vendor)"
- **Cause**: These contacts are registered as **vendors only** in Zoho, not customers
- **Affected shops**: Shahkar, Raika, Elina, Roj 2141, Alireza, Bellarti, Belinda, Arash, Fereshteh Karami, Pouya Shop

This is expected behavior - sales orders and invoices can only be created for contacts with `customer` or `both` type.

### Sandbox Now Contains

| Entity | Count |
|--------|-------|
| Contacts (Customers/Vendors) | 524 |
| Products | 477 |
| Sales Orders | 296 (with placeholder line items) |
| Invoices | 234 (with placeholder line items) |

### Notes

- Sales orders/invoices have placeholder line items (original export didn't include line-level details)
- All data is in draft status
- Sandbox org ID: `20111340673` (Pippa Sandbox)
