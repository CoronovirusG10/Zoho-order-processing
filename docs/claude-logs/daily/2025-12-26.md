## Session 1: Predeployment Readiness Audit (CTO Orchestrator)

### Work Completed

| Time | Task | Outcome |
|------|------|---------|
| Start | Created _predeploy folder structure | Directories created for logs, evidence, artefacts |
| +2m | Launched 8 parallel subagents | A-H audits running concurrently |
| +5m | Launched cross-tenant runbook agent | App registration documentation |
| +5m | Fetched Microsoft documentation | Foundry Workflows, Capability Hosts, Hosted Agents |
| +15m | Subagent A complete | Repo audit: NEEDS_ACTION (no git, no CI/CD) |
| +18m | Subagent B complete | IaC audit: PASS (14 Bicep files validate) |
| +20m | Subagent C complete | Azure audit: NEEDS_ACTION (missing App Insights, blob versioning) |
| +22m | Subagent D complete | Foundry audit: NEEDS_ACTION (AI Search missing) |
| +25m | Subagent E complete | Teams audit: NEEDS_ACTION (multi-tenant deprecated) |
| +27m | Subagent F complete | Zoho audit: PASS (API health OK) |
| +28m | Subagent G complete | Security audit: PASS (Key Vault, logging configured) |
| +29m | Subagent H complete | Multimodal audit: PASS (Excel parser implemented) |
| +30m | Created final deliverables | 5 main reports + 3 artefacts |

### Issues Encountered

| Issue | Resolution |
|-------|------------|
| Not a git repository | BLOCKER - must initialize before deployment |
| Multi-tenant bot deprecated July 2025 | HIGH - need single-tenant migration plan |
| AI Search not deployed | HIGH - required for capability host |
| App Insights not configured | MEDIUM - needs deployment |
| Blob versioning not enabled | MEDIUM - needs configuration |

### Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Used CTO Orchestrator pattern | Preserve context for coordination, delegate deep work |
| Launched 9 parallel subagents | Maximize efficiency, each agent has own context |
| Focus on read-only validation | No deployments, only auditing |
| Created comprehensive runbooks | Enable self-service deployment |

## Subagent Performance Summary

| Agent | Duration | Tools Used | Context Efficiency |
|-------|----------|------------|-------------------|
| A (Repo) | ~8min | Bash, Read, Write | High |
| B (IaC) | ~6min | Read, Bash, Write | High |
| C (Azure) | ~10min | Bash, Write | Medium (Azure CLI waits) |
| D (Foundry) | ~12min | Read, Grep, Glob, Write | High |
| E (Teams) | ~8min | Glob, Grep, Read, Write | High |
| F (Zoho) | ~10min | Bash, Read, Write | Medium (API calls) |
| G (Security) | ~12min | Grep, Read, Bash, Write | High |
| H (Multimodal) | ~8min | Grep, Read, Write | High |
| Cross-tenant | ~15min | Read, Write | High |

**Total parallel execution time:** ~15 minutes (vs ~80 minutes sequential)
**Context preserved:** CTO received only summaries (~1-2K tokens each)
